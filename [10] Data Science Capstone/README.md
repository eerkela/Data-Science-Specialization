This repository represents my capstone project to finish off the John's Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

The application can be found at this link:
https://eerkela.shinyapps.io/Smoothing_Comparison_For_NGram_Text_Prediction/

And a brief slide deck describing it can be found here:
https://rpubs.com/eerkela/775520

I've also written up an extensive R Markdown report detailing the theoretical background and implementation details of the application (Capstone-Project - Final).  Feel free to check it out if you're curious.

Thank you for your interest!!!
